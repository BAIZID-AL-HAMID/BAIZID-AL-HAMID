- 👨‍💻 Aspiring Software Engineer & Hospitality Expert 🌟

- 👋 Hello, I’m Baizid Al Hamid, but you can call me Al (アル). While I have a deep-rooted passion for crafting exceptional
  hospitality experiences, I am now channeling my skills and enthusiasm towards a future in software engineering. 🖥️

- 🏨 My journey in the hospitality industry, particularly in Kyoto, Japan, has been rich and diverse. Starting at
  ホテルハイアットリージェンシー京都’s Café33レストラン, I’ve worked in esteemed places like ザ・リッツ・カールトン京都’s La•Locandaレストラン.
  Each role, from breakfast staff to front-of-house, has sharpened my attention to detail and adaptability – skills crucial in technology as well.

- 🍳 At フォーシーズンズホテル京都 and 京都ホテルオークラ, I gained invaluable experience in event service and guest relations, further
- enhancing my capability to understand and meet user needs, a vital aspect of software development.

- 📚 Concurrently, I am honing my technical skills through my Information Systems Science and Engineering studies at
- Ritsumeikan University. This education is not just about acquiring technical knowledge; it’s about integrating my hospitality
- insights to innovate in tech, focusing on user experience and service quality.

- 🔍 My goal now is to merge my hospitality expertise with software engineering to create unique, user-centric solutions.
- I’m excited to explore opportunities where I can apply my unique blend of skills to the tech world.

- 🤝 I’m eager to connect with professionals from both the hospitality and tech industries. Let’s share insights, explore
- collaborative possibilities, or simply have an engaging conversation about our shared interests in service excellence and technology.

Feel free to reach out to discuss technology, hospitality, or anything in between!
